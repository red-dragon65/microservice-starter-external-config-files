# These are global configurations for all services

# Precedence:
# External Config Server application specific configuration file
# External Config Server global configuration file
# Local application.properties file
# Local boostrap.properties file

# Note: Even though the boostrap.properties file has a lower configuration precedence
# than the application.properties file, the boostrap file runs first on application
# startup in order to get the external configuration data!


# These are custom properties
external.property=This_is_a_global_property_from_the_config_server

# Note about precedence:
# The 'some.property' value in this external file will be overridden by
# the other external file called 'config-client-app.properties'.
